* The peer-reviewed paper published in _The Lancet_ is avilable [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00634-6) 
* Raw model outputs, including charts, crosstabs, etc, are in `released_outputs/`
* If you are interested in how we defined our covariates, take a look at the [study definition](analysis/study_definition.py); this is written in `python`, but non-programmers should be able to understand what is going on there
* If you are interested in how we defined our code lists, look in the [codelists folder](./codelists/) or visit https://www.opencodelists.org/
* Developers and epidemiologists interested in the code should review
[DEVELOPERS.md](docs/DEVELOPERS.md).
* The original pre-print of our paper is available on MedRxiv [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.22.20198754v1)
